##### Why do we wrap return with brackets?
Note React components must start with capital letter.

When you return a multi-line elements, always add brackets, else any code after return line will be ignored.

##### Can we return multiple JSX elements?
No, to do it we must wrap them in a single tag with a Fragment, `<></>`
```html
<>
	<h1>{userName}'s Todos</h1>
	<ul></ul>
</>
```

#### Why do multiple JSX tags have to be wrapped?
While JSX looks like HTML, under the hood they are converted into JS objects. You can't return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. Which is also why you can't return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag.


##### How to write a basic component with destructured props?
React component accepts a single `props` object, which is why we use destructuring when defining the components.
```ts
// This is a simple react component
// Recall this is default export
export default function Congratulations({ name, age }) {
  return (
    <h1>`Good job ${name} who is ${age} years old!`</h1>
  );
}


// Arrow syntax version with default export
const Congratulations = ({ name, age }) => (
  <h1>`Good job ${name} who is ${age} years old!`</h1>
);
export default Congratulations;

// To import
import Congratulations from './Congratulations';

// To use, notice no braces if we want to pass string or number
<Congratulations name='Jason' age=28 ></Congratulations>


// Destructuring
// size has a default value, it's used if no size prop
function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) {}

// Equivalent to above
function Avatar(props) {  
	let person = props.person;  
	let size = props.size;  
	//...
}
```

##### Rendering logic and markup live in the same place
![[Pasted image 20240402162401.png|700]]


#### Double curly braces in React
They might seem confusing. But outer curly braces is just for writing js code. And inner curly braces is an object.

```ts
export default function TodoList() {
  // outer curly braces is for writing js code, inner is denoting an obj
  return (
    <ul style={{
	  // it can also be an obj, we destructure it, ...colorVar
	  // where colorVar contains 'backgroundColor' and 'color'
      backgroundColor: 'black',
      color: 'pink'
    }}>
      <li>Improve the videophone</li>
      <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
      <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```


#### Passing JSX as children prop

`children` is a special prop
```ts
// definition
function Card({ children }) {
	return (
		<div className='card'>
			{children}
		</div>
	);
}

// usage, the Card prop `children` will be set to the Avatar component
<Card>
	<Avatar size={100} person={{name:'jason', age: 28}} />
</Card>
```

Props are readonly snapshots in time, they can change overtime. We can change them by updating the state.


#### Conditional Rendering
You can achieve it with if else, ternary or logical &&.

```ts
// if else
if (isPacked) {  
	return <li className="item">{name} ✔</li>;
}	
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;


// ternary operator
return (
	<li className="item"> {isPacked ? name + ' ✔' : name} </li>
);

// If ternary operator is on the outer level and not inside a tag, don't need braces
return (
	isTrue ? <div>{"hello"}</div> : <div>Bye</div>
);


// &&
return (
	 <div>
	      <WelcomeMessage />
	      {isLoggedIn && <LoggedInMessage />}
	</div>
);

// same as ternary operator, don't need {} if not nested
return (
	isTrue && <div>Hello</div>
);
```

##### Don't put a number on left side of logical &&
React consider false, null, undefined as holes in the tree and don't render anything in their places.

React converts the left side to bool automatically. If left side is 0, whole expression will get that value. So React will render 0.

```ts
// wrong, will just render 0
messageCount && <p>New messages</p>

// correct conditional rendering
messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>
```



#### Rendering list, why it needs a key prop, suitable values for key

List items need `key` prop because it tells React which array item each component corresponds to. This is important when we need to manipulate the list items, e.g. update, delete... 

The main purpose of the `key` prop is to ensure that the state is tied to a specific component instance. Without it, React might recycle a component instance and reuse its state in a different place, leading to unexpected behavior. Essentially, you might end up with a component that maintains a state from a previous component.
Keys should be unique within an array, however okay for different arrays to have different keys. Not recommended to use idx as keys, although we can set up a counter variable and make it equal to the key.


Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. `key={Math.random()}`. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

When a key changes, React will create a new component instance rather than update the current one. Keys are usually used for dynamic lists but are also useful here.

If your data comes from a db, you can use id/pk. If your data is sourced locally, can use `uuid` as key.

Note key won't be received as a prop

```ts
// assume there is a 'people' array
// first we filter to get the desired people
// then we map each person to a list item
export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession === 'chemist'
  );
  
  const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
	// We can also map to a component instead of JSX
	// note the key prop of 'li' will be supplied by person object within Person component
	// person => <Person key={person.id} person={person}/>
    <li key={person.id}>
    
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
      
    </li>
  );

  // actual rendering
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```


If you extract a `ListItem` to a separate component, then the key should be on `<ListItem />` elements in the array instead of on `<li>` tag inside `ListItem`.
```ts
// Correct usage
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.    
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />  );

// Incorrect usage
function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Wrong! There is no need to specify the key here:    
    <li key={value.toString()}>{value}</li>
  );
}
```
  


##### Rendering several nodes within a list item
We can again use fragments here
```ts
const listItems = people.map(person => (
  <Fragment key={person.id}>
    <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    <p>{person.bio}</p>
  </Fragment>
));
```



#### UI as a tree
React model UI as a tree.

![[preserving_state_dom_tree.webp|600]]
React will create a UI tree from the components, this is the virtual DOM. For any changes to the DOM, that change is first made to the virtual DOM. This UI tree is then used to render to the DOM.
