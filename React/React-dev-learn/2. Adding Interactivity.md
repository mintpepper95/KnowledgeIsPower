#### How to add an event handler? What happens if you execute the event handler when passing it?

To add an event handler, just pass the fn as a prop to the component.

Event handlers are the best place for side effects.

```ts
// Note we pass the event handler itself to the prop, not the result by calling event handler, eg. handleClick(), doing the latter will the fn fire immediately, because code inside {} executes right away, and it will fire everytime the component renders
<button onClick={handleClick}>


// Often you want the parent to pass a event handler to child.
// Here what ever component that renders Button passes its own onClick, and this onClick is then passed to button
const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
	return (
		<button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
	)
}

// By convention, event handler props start with on, onXXX
// We want to name props after app specific interactions,
```


#### Event propagation and default behaviour and how to stop them

Event handlers will also catch events from any child of the component.
Event bubbles up the tree.

```ts
// When I click on the button, the button onClick fires first. Since button is inside the parent, the parent will also fire.
const Toolbar = () => {
	return (
		<div onClick={() => console.log('hello from parent')} >
			<button onClick={() => console.log('hello from child')}>
			Child
			</button>
		</div>
	)
}

// stopping propagation
const Toolbar = () => {
	return (
		<div onClick={() => console.log('hello from parent')} >
			<button onClick={e => {
				// Stops the propagation and do its thing
				e.stopPropagation();
				console.log('hello from child')
			}}>
			Child
			</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

To stop event propagation, `e.stopPropagation()`. this prevents the event from bubbling up. Therefore parent's event handler that reacts to the same event does not run.

##### Preventing default behaviour
Some browser events have default events, e.g.. `form` submit event, happens when a button inside it is clicked, cause the whole page to reload by default.

```ts
const Signup = () => {
	return (
		<form onSubmit={(e) => {
			// onSubmit will reload the page
			console.log('submitting');
			// Stop it
			e.preventDefault();	
		}}>
		</form>
	);
}
```



#### Explain state vs local vars and why hooks are top level

##### What's special about a state vs a local variable for React?
Local variables don't persist between renders, and updating them won't trigger renders.

Data needs to be retained between renders. Change should trigger React to re-render.
`useState` hook provides these things.

##### Hooks
Hooks are functions that by convention starts with `use` and hooks onto React internal memory. They are available at top level inside the component. 

So how does React know which `useState` state to return?
It knows because hooks rely on a stable call order on every render. 
That's why you can't call hooks inside if else, loops, or nested functions because it will mess up the call order. 

State is local to the component instance.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

// array destructuring, since useState returns an array of size 2
// On subsequent re-rendering, index may change, React will see useState(0), but it also remembers index has changed, so it returns that value instead.
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```


#### Describe the 3 steps of a screen update in React

1. Triggering a render
2. Rendering the component
3. Committing to the DOM


##### Triggering a render
1. Component initial render
2. When component or its parent state has changed

##### Rendering (calling) the component
When you trigger a render, React calls your component to figure out what to display. This is recursive, if updated component returns some other components, React will render them next.

Component should be pure, given same input, it should always return JSX.

##### React commits changes to DOM
For re-render, React will apply minimal necessary changes to make DOM match latest rendering output.

Here React sees that `input` appears in JSX in the same place, so doesn't touch it.
```ts
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
	  // Here React only updates <h1>, note input doesn't update ( text persists between renders ) when Clock component re-renders
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```


#### What does it mean when we call state 'snapshot'?

Note even after updating the state, the current render will always use the current state value, not the updated state value. You can think state value as a immutable snapshot tied to a particular render. The state value will never change inside a render.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
	    // Although we set it 3 times,
	    // number only increments once per click
	    
		// number is always static during a particular render
		// updating it only signals React to change it on the next render
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```


#### Queueing a series of state updates
Looking at the previous example below.
React wait until all code inside event handler is run before processing state update.
That's why re-render happens after all the `setNumber` calls.

It's like a waiter wait til you finish all the ordering and then going to the kitchen instead of rushing to the kitchen after every dish you ordered.

This allows you to update multiple state variables, without triggering too many re-renders.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```


##### What is an updater function and what's it for?
To update a state multiple times, we need to pass in the current value in the setter.

When you call `useState` in the next render, React will take the 3 updater functions. Apply them one by one and pass the return value to the next one 
```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
        setNumber(n => n + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```


##### What happens if you update a state after replacing it?
```ts
<button onClick={() => {  
	setNumber(number + 5);  
	setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>
```
First, React will replace it with number + 5, and then add 1 to the result. So it will be 6 given initial state value is 0.


##### What happens if you replace the state after updating it?
```ts
<button onClick={() => {  
	setNumber(number + 5);  
	setNumber(n => n + 1);  
	setNumber(42);
}}>
```
It will set state value to 42.


##### Updating Objects in State
When you update objects in state, you should always create a new one with spread sytnax instead of updating them directly. 

```ts
// Not really related, this is just an example to remind you how to write label and input
<label>
	First name:
	<input
	  value={person.firstName}
	  onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
	/>
</label>
```

Note spread syntax copying is shallow so we gotta do it for nested objects as well.
```ts
setPerson({
	...person, 
	artwork: {
	...person.artwork, 
	city: 'New Delhi' 
	}
});
```


##### Explain why mutating state is not desirable in React
* Debugging - if you don't mutate state, you can see how state has changed between renders
* Optimisation - Optimisation rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If `prevObj === obj`, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.
* Convention - We treat state as a snapshot
* 

##### Updating Arrays in State

You should treat array as immutable when you store them in state.
So avoid things like push, unshift, pop, shift, splice. Use things like concat, `[...arr]`, filter, slice, map...

```ts
// Replacing element at a certain idx in arr
const nextCounters = counters.map((c, i) => {
	if (i === index) {
		// Increment the clicked counter
		return c + 1;
	} else {
		// The rest haven't changed
		return c;
	}

// Removing an element with filter, filter returns a new arr
artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id);


// Inserting into arr
const nextArtists = [
      // Items before the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),
      // New item:
      { id: nextId++, name: name },
      // Items after the insertion point:
      ...artists.slice(insertAt)
    ];


// Updating objects inside Array
setMyList(
	myList.map(artwork => {
		if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
			return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };  
		} else { 
			return artwork;  
}}));
```
