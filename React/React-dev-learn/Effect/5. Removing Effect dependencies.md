#### useEffect deps should match useEffect code
When you write an Effect, first specify how to start and possibly stop whatever your Effect is doing.

If you want to change the deps in your `useEffect` deps array, you should
1. Change the code of your Effect or how your reactive values are declared.
2. Leave deps array empty, and follow linter and add all relevant deps to match your changed code. Does it make sense to the Effect to re-run when any of them change?
3. If you are not happy about the deps, go back to one and repeat.

#### Why is omitting deps from deps array dangerous?

In the following effect, we did not include onTick function in the deps array for `useEffect`. React will always use the `onTick` defined in the first render, where count = 0 and increment = 1. Therefore count always gets set to 1.

```ts
export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [increment, setIncrement] = useState(1);

  function onTick() {
	setCount(count + increment);
  }

  // This effect now only runs on mount
  // React will forever keep using onTick from initial render. During that render, count was 0 and increment was 1. Therefore we always see 1.
  // We have to include count and increment
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [count, increment]);


  // ignore, this is jsx for displaying
  return (
    <>
      <h1>
        Counter: {count}
        <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Every second, increment by:
        <button disabled={increment === 0} onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i - 1);
        }}>–</button>
        <b>{increment}</b>
        <button onClick={() => {
          setIncrement(i => i + 1);
        }}>+</button>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}



// If we want to fix the issue without adding to deps
  useEffect(() => {
	// correct, this will take whatever current count and update it, no stale state
    const id = setInterval(() => setCount(count => count + increment), 1000);

	// wrong, count = 0, increment = 1, we set count to 1.
	// However, in the after the next render, count is still 0, and increment is still 1, therefore setCount sets to the same value, which is 1.
	// Directly using count may use a stale value.
	const id = setInterval(() => setCount(count + increment), 1000);
    
    
    return () => clearInterval(id);
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);
```


#### Removing unnecessary dependencies
Every time you adjust Effect deps array, ask yourself, does it make sense for Effect to re-run when any of those deps change?

* You may want to re-execute different parts of your Effect under some conditions.
* You may want to only read latest value instead of reacting to changes.
* A dependency may change too often *unintentionally* cause it's an object or function.

##### Should code be an Effect at all?
This is the first thing to ask.
Consider below.

Here the effect code would run on initial render, and then on every re-render when `submitted` is updated, it's guarded so logic only executes when `submitted` is true.

```ts
function Form() {
	const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);  
	
	useEffect(() => {
		// 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
		if (submitted) {
			post('/api/register');
			showNotification('Successfully registered!');
		}
	// while it's okay now, in the future if we add additional deps, this will introduce bugs because it will post multiple times!
	}, [submitted]);  
	
	function handleSubmit() { setSubmitted(true);  }  // ...
}
```


##### Is your Effect doing several unrelated things?

Consider a shipping form where user needs to select their city and area.
We fetch cities from server according to selected country.

```ts
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((json) => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    
    // 🔴 Avoid: A single Effect synchronizes two independent processes
    if (city) {
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((json) => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
    }
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country, city]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

By including city fetching logic in the same Effect, when user selects a different city, it will re-run and fetch the cities by country again, which is unnecessary. Instead we can move the fetch city logic into a separate Effect.

* We want to sync cities based on country prop
* We want to sync areas based on city state

##### Are you reading some state to calculate next state?

Here we set messages inside the effect, this creates a problem.
Every new message will trigger a re-render, and after the re-render it will run the effect, which makes chat re-connect.

To fix this, don't read `messages` inside the Effect. Pass an `updater function` so we no longer need `messages` in the deps array.

```ts
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
	  const connection = createConnection();
	  connection.connect();
	  connection.on("message", (receivedMessage) => {

		// we need messages in deps array, WRONG
	    setMessages([...messages, receivedMessage]);

		// we no longer need messages in the deps array, CORRECT
		// React will put your updater function in a queue
		// During next render, React goes through the queue to calculate final state value
		setMessages(msg => [...msgs, receivedMessage]);
	  });
	  
	  return () => connection.disconnect();
	
	// Including messages introduce a problem
	}, [roomId, messages]);

}
```


#### Does some reactive value change unintentionally?

Sometimes, we want Effect to react to certain reactive value, but that value may change more than we like.

However this code is problematic, because a new `options` object is created on every re-render. Therefore it runs the Effect again. This problem concerns both options and functions ( aside from react useState setter function of course ).

Therefore, we should avoid objects and functions as Effect deps.
```ts
const ChatRoom = ({roomId}) => {

	// options is defined in top level of component, so it's a reactive value because it uses roomId;
	const options = {
		serverUrl: serverUrl,
		roomId: roomId
	};

	useEffect(() => {
		const connection = createConnection(options);
		connection.connect();

		return () => connection.disconnect();
	}, [options]);
}
```

One way we can address this is to move the object or function outside the component, if it does not depend on any props or states.

```ts
const options = {
  serverUrl: "https://localhost:1234",
  roomId: "music",
};

function ChatRoom() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

Alternative we can move objects and functions to inside Effect, so that it's no longer a dep.
```ts
const serverUrl = "https://localhost:1234";

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    // moved to inside of Effect
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId,
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

##### Read primitive values from objects
Sometimes a component may receive an object from props
```ts
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}

// Somewhere in the parent
<ChatRoom roomId={roomId} options={{serverUrl: serverUrl, roomId: roomId}} />
```

This would cause your Effect to re-connect every time because when the parent component re-renders ( it causes child to re-render as well ), and `options` is different in every re-render. To fix this, read info from object outside the Effect.

Same approach works for functions as well. Remember only pure functions are safe to call during rendering.

```ts
function ChatRoom({ options }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  const { roomId, serverUrl } = options;
  useEffect(() => {
    // Note we effectively create options object inside Effect, making it non-reactive to avoid having `options` in the effect deps array
    const connection = createConnection({
      roomId: roomId,
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```


#### Quiz
Here, we always create and clear the interval, fix this.
```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('✅ Creating an interval');
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('⏰ Interval tick');
      // WRONG
      setCount(count + 1);

	  // CORRECT
	  setCount(count => count + 1)	
    }, 1000);
    return () => {
      console.log('❌ Clearing an interval');
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [count]);

  return <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
}
```

Ans: Intervals are constantly recreated because `count` is a dep in the deps array. This makes the effect run every time count changes, causing interval be recreated. We can instead use the updater function, this will remove `count` from deps and means we no longer run the effect every time count changes, but still be able to update count given we use the updater function.
