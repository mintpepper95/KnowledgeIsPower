Components may mount, update (re-render) or unmount during its lifecycle.



#### How Effect relates to rendering, describe the Effect lifecycle

Take example of a chatroom.
```ts
function ChatRoom({ roomId /* "general" */ }) {  
	useEffect(() => {
		// Connect
		const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); 
		connection.connect();
		return () => { 
			// Disconnect
			connection.disconnect();
		};  
	}, [roomId]);
```

When the user picks a different room, we want two things to happen.
1. User should disconnect to the old roomId.
2. User should connect to the new roomid.

This is exactly what `useEffect` do when a dep has changed. After the re-render, the Effect runs the cleanup function ( which runs during re-render and unmounting ) and then re-run the Effect again. We are basically resynchronising.

When thinking about Effect, think in terms of how to start synchronisation and how to stop it. Don't think effect as callbacks that fire at a specific time, like after mounting etc.

##### How React knows your Effect needs to re-sync
Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at deps array of the Effect. If any values in the array in different to what's in the previous render ( React use `Object.is` which does shallow comparison ), React will resync.

##### Each Effect represent a separate sync process
Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time, instead it should be put into a separate `useEffect`.

E.g. Adding logging visit logic to connect effect is a bad idea. So we should put cohesive logic into one Effect, rather than separating it into different Effect just to make code cleaner.

Note aside from props and state, all values you calculate from them are also reactive. This is why variables inside the component should also be in the Effect deps array.

A mutable value like `ref.current` can't be a dep in the deps array. While the ref object returned by `useRef` can be a dep, its `current` property is intentionally mutable. It lets you track something without triggering a re-render. And therefore it's not a reactive value. So React won't know to re-run your Effect when it changes.

In some cases, React knows the value never changes even if it's declared inside the component. E.g, the `set` function returned from `useState` and ref object returned by `useRef`, these are stable - they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render.
Stable values are not reactive so you can omit them from the deps array.

In more detail, the `setState` function's reference remains the same across all re-renders. Same with `useRef`, it returns a mutable ref object which does not change across re-renders. While the `current` property can be updated, reference to the ref object remains the same.

Note if you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from Effect, they will be different on every render.


```ts
// inside the component
// note handleMove is declared outside the Effect
  function handleMove(e) {
    if (canMove) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
  }

// Include handleMove into the deps array, means the useEffect will sync upon every re-render because handleMove is recreated.
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, [handleMove]);


// Solution - move handleMove fn inside Effect, and make it depend on canMove
  useEffect(() => {
	
	function handleMove(e) {
	    if (canMove) {
	      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
	    }
	}

    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, [canMove]);
```


An example of an Effect with custom hook, the ideal is that most effects should be replaceable with custom hooks.

```ts
// Dupe logic

// useEffect 1
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetchData('/planets').then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        console.log('Fetched a list of planets.');
        setPlanetList(result);
        setPlanetId(result[0].id); // Select the first planet
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, []);

// useEffect 2
  useEffect(() => {
    if (planetId === '') {
      // Nothing is selected in the first box yet
      return;
    }

    let ignore = false;
    fetchData('/planets/' + planetId + '/places').then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        console.log('Fetched a list of places on "' + planetId + '".');
        setPlaceList(result);
        setPlaceId(result[0].id); // Select the first place
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, [planetId]);



// Using custom hook to extract common logic
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchData } from './api.js';

export function useSelectOptions(url) {
  const [list, setList] = useState(null);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    if (url === null) {
      return;
    }

    let ignore = false;
    fetchData(url).then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setList(result);
        setSelectedId(result[0].id);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, [url]);
  return [list, selectedId, setSelectedId];
}

// Page
export default function Page() {
  const [
    planetList,
    planetId,
    setPlanetId
  ] = useSelectOptions('/planets');

  const [
    placeList,
    placeId,
    setPlaceId
  ] = useSelectOptions(planetId ? `/planets/${planetId}/places` : null);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Pick a planet:{' '}
        <select value={planetId} onChange={e => {
          setPlanetId(e.target.value);
        }}>
          {planetList?.map(planet =>
            <option key={planet.id} value={planet.id}>{planet.name}</option>
          )}
        </select>
      </label>
      <label>
        Pick a place:{' '}
        <select value={placeId} onChange={e => {
          setPlaceId(e.target.value);
        }}>
          {placeList?.map(place =>
            <option key={place.id} value={place.id}>{place.name}</option>
          )}
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <p>You are going to: {placeId || '...'} on {planetId || '...'} </p>
    </>
  );
}
