#### Choosing between event handlers and Effect
Long story short, event handlers for when we want to trigger something based on a particular *interaction*. Effects are NOT related to interactions. It doesn't matter if user clicks something. It ensures component is *synced* to some external system.

Reactive values - Props, state and variables declared inside the component. Reactive values can change due to a re-render. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes of reactive values differently.

Event handlers - They only run when some interaction is performed, they read reactive values only, they don't re-run in response to changes in reactive values.

Effects - They not only read your reactive values, they will re-run after a re-render occurs. A change in the reactive values means we must *re-sync*.

For example, for a chat app, when a `roomId` changes, we must disconnect the old room and connect to the new room.

#### Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects
Imagine we want to show a notification when user connects to a chatroom.
We read the theme so we can show this notification in current color.

```ts
// Here, due to theme being a dep in deps array, Effect is re-ran if we update theme
const ChatRoom = ({roomId, theme}) => {
	useEffect(() => {
		const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
		connection.on('connected', () => {
			// This line shouldn't be reactive, one way is to remove theme from deps array, however the norm is to refactor, all reactive values should ideally be defined in deps array
			showNotification('Connected', theme);
		});

		connection.connect();
		return () => connection.disconnect();
	}, [roomId, theme]);
}
```
