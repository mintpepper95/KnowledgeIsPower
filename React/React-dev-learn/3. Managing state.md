#### Thinking about UI declaratively
In React, we think about UI declaratively.
1. We identify component's different states
2. Determine what triggers each state
3. Represent the states using `useState
4. Remove non-essential states
5. Connect event handlers to set the state

Think about how we implement UI without React in vanilla JS, when something changes, we need to write code that enable/disable/hide/show things etc. Then we would need to bind those code to events for the html elements.

In React it's more of you declare what you want to show based on the state (via conditional rendering), and then update the state through event handlers ( rather than manipulating the html elements directly ).


Take example of a form. Here are the various states for a form.
Empty -> Typing -> Submitting -> Error or Success

We might be tempted to come up the following states.
```ts
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);


const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
```

However, many of states are redundant.
E.g. 
We don't need `isError`, we already have error.
We don't need both `isEmpty` and `isTyping`.
Also notice `isTyping` and `isSubmitting` can't both be true.

```ts
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing') // typing, submitting, success
```

Now we can connect event handlers to set state. So basically trigger those setter functions inside event handler.


Eg. A quiz form built in React
When you have a functional component like this, when it re-renders the whole body is re-executed, React then compares the difference between current and previous virtual DOM and then only updates part of DOM that's changed.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus('submitting');
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus('success');
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus('typing');
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>City quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <textarea
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === 'submitting'}
        />
        <br />
        <button disabled={
          answer.length === 0 ||
          status === 'submitting'
        }>
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null &&
          <p className="Error">
            {error.message}
          </p>
        }
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // Pretend it's hitting the network.
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== 'lima'
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error('Good guess but a wrong answer. Try again!'));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
}
```


Note state is pre-served between re-renders. And it happens outside the component. When your component re-renders React gives it the current value of states. 
This is also why React doesn't allow you to call hooks conditionally, all executions of the function must have same # of hooks and in same sequence.  See [[2. Adding Interactivity#Hooks]]



#### Choosing State Structure
1. Group related state. If you want to update two or more state variables at same time, consider merging them into a single state.
2. Avoid contradictions in state, eg. states that disagree with each other, because you would leave room for mistakes. Eg. have two states, isSending and isSent, leaves room for mistakes and makes it hard to understand.
4. Avoid redundant state, if you can calculation some info from props or existing states, don't add new ones. Also don't set prop to as state. When the component re-renders later when prop changes, state won't be updated, as state is only initialised with the prop value in the first render and we don't explicitly update it. Mirroring only makes sense when you want to ignore **all updates** for a specific prop.
5. Avoid dupe state, eg. storing id of an array item instead of the array item itself. If you store the array item itself in the state, later you may update the array, now array item in the state is no longer found in the array item, so out of sync.
6. Avoid deeply nested state, prefer structure state flat. As updating deeply nested states is very verbose.

We can have Set and other data structures in a state.

Eg. A red ball that tracks cursor movement
```ts
const[x, setX] = useState(0);
const[y, setY] = useState(0);

// This is better, if the state variables change together
const [position, setPosition] = useState({x: 0, y: 0});


// Following example
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });


  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        /* Without translate, div will just sit at top left corner */
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  )
}
```


##### Why not mirror props in state
```ts
// In this case, if parent passes a different messageColor
// color won't be updated, as messageColor is only used for initial value
// We should just use the prop directly
function Message({ messageColor }) {  
	const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);
}


// Mirroring props in state only makes sense if we want to ignore all future changes to the prop
function Message({ initialColor }) {
	const [color, setColor] = useState(initialColor);
}
```



#### Sharing state between components - lifting state up
When you want state of two components to change together, move the state to the closest common parent, and then pass down the state, and also pass the event handler to allow child to update the state - Lifting state up

Eg. Here only one panel should be active.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Accordion() {
	// Note initial state, 0 here, is only used on first render
	const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);

	return (
		<>
		<h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
		<Panel title='About' isActive={activeIndex === 0} onShow={()=>setActiveIndex(0)}>
			blah blah blah
		</>

		<Panel title='Etymology' isActive={activeIndex === 1} onShow={()=>setActiveIndex(1)}>
			blah blah blah
		</>	
	)
}

// We can accept an argument ( essentially props ), 
// or destructure it directly like shown here
function Panel = ({
	title,
	children,
	isActive,
	onShow
}) {
	return (
		<section className="panel">
			<h3>{title}</h3>
			{isActive? (<p>{children}</p>) : (<button onClick={onShow}>Show</button>) }
		</section>
	);
}



// Btw, when you have a list of items, you can use the map function if you need to create some dom elements based on data in each item
{items.map(item => (
	<p key={item.id}>
		<div>item.name</div>
		<div>item.value</div>
	</p>
))}

```

##### A single source of truth for each state
For each unique piece of state, you will have to choose the component that owns it. This is known as single source of truth. It means that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that info. So we lift up the shared state to the common shared parent, and pass it down.


#### Explain how React decide between preserve or reset state in a component when the component remounts
When you give a component state, that state does not live inside the component, it's held inside React ( which explains why state persist across renders ). React associates each piece of state with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.

##### An example of resetting state
If we remove the component via conditional rendering, then its state disappears. When react removes a component, it destroys its state. For example, imagine a Counter component with initial state of 0. You keep clicking it to update the state. But if you remove/unmount it via conditional rendering, then state is lost when you add back/mount the component again.

```ts
{showHint && <Hint />}
<Form />
```
In the above case, toggling of `showHint` will NOT unmount and remount the Form component, thus its state is persisted.




##### How React decide to reset state
So basically during  if component sits at same place in the virtual DOM tree, it will not be destroyed. React updates it in place, ensuring the state is kept across renders.

But if the component now sits somewhere else in the virtual DOM, it will be unmounted and then mounted again, so state is destroyed, unless it's persisted using other techniques like context.

Note this is different to React.memo.
This is about whether the actual DOM nodes unmount and remount or updated in-place, React.memo is about whether the component re-renders.



##### Explain how the same component at same position preserves state
In this case, updating `isFancy` does NOT reset Counter state because despite conditionally rendering only one of the two Counters. You always have a `Counter` as the first child of the div. 

Because it's the same component at the same position in the virtual DOM, from React's view, it's the same counter. You can even return one of the two jsx based on some conditions. As long as the Counter sits at the same position, the state is retained. React doesn't know where you place conditions, all it sees is the tree you return.


```ts
export default function App() {
  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);
  
  // Notice the 2 Counters will render at the same position,
  // therefore its state is NOT lost and retained even if 'isFancy' changes
  return (
    <div>
      {isFancy ? (
        <Counter isFancy={true} /> 
      ) : (
        <Counter isFancy={false} /> 
      )}
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isFancy}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsFancy(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Use fancy styling
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}
```


##### Explain what happens to the children in the subtree when a component is removed
![[Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 23-15-31 Preserving and Resetting State – React.png|650]]

So if you want to preserve state between re-renders, the structure of the tree needs to match up from one render to another. If structure is different, state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.

Never nest component function definitions!
* Note you should not define a component a inside another component b. When you do this, it means a different component a is created for every render of b. React will see that you are rendering a different component in the same position, and reset all the states below. *



##### How to reset the state at same position
By default React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. If we don't want that, we can use 'key' prop. Which resets the state in the component.

Specifying a key tells React to use **key as part of the position, instead of order within the parent**. Note keys aren't globally unique, they only specify position within the parent.

So we can also use key prop to force React to unmount and remount the component ( and all children within it ) thus resetting the state.

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';

const players = ['Jason', 'Jone', 'George', 'Tim'];

export default function Scoreboard() { 
  const [playerIdx, setPlayerIdx] = useState(0);

  // Without key prop, Counter will have the same score state ( since it's defined within Counter ) when the prop 'person' changes
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter key={playerIdx} person={players[playerIdx]} />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setPlayerIdx((playerIdx + 1) % players.length);
      }}>
        Next player!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

###### An example
Typing a message and switching recipient does not reset the input. 
```ts
<ContactList contacts={contacts} onSelect={contact=>setContact(contact)} />
<Chat contacts={contact} />
```
In this case, React is re-rendering Chat when props change. However, `textarea` value comes from `useState`, which is initially empty. Since we didn't update text state via `setText` when changing recipient, that state is persisted across renders.

To force component to reset its state, we can pass it a different key. Like 
```html
<Chat key={contact.email} />
```
Now switching between recipients will reset Chat component. This is because a different key tells React this is a different chat component, and thus it's re-created from scratch rather than re-rendered. And when it's re-created from scratch, useState will take the initial value of empty so text is cleared.

###### Another example
If you want to reverse the order of two components and keeping their states.
You could have if else branch for rendering, while the order will be different ( so state will be loss ), adding a key prop will fix this and persist the state.

```ts
if (reverse) {
    return (
      <>
        <Field key='lastName' label="Last name" /> 
        <Field key='firstName' label="First name" />
        {checkbox}
      </>
    );
  } else {
    return (
      <>
        <Field key='firstName' label="First name" /> 
        <Field key='lastName' label="Last name" />
        {checkbox}
      </>
    );    
  }
```



Eg. Imagine we have some `<Contact />` components as list items. We can change the order of the list such that . If we want to maintain the state within each Contact, we can do something like key={contact.id} .

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';
import Contact from './Contact.js';

export default function ContactList() {
  const [reverse, setReverse] = useState(false);

  const displayedContacts = [...contacts];
  if (reverse) {
    displayedContacts.reverse();
  }


  // Note here, li key={contact.id} means we persist the component state based on the contact.id. Without key prop, the state is maintained but it would be incorrect when we reverse the list.
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          value={reverse}
          onChange={e => {
            setReverse(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />{' '}
        Show in reverse order
      </label>
      <ul>
        {displayedContacts.map(contact =>
          <li key={contact.id}>
            <Contact contact={contact} />
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

const contacts = [
  { id: 0, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@mail.com' },
  { id: 1, name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@mail.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Taylor', email: 'taylor@mail.com' }
];

```



#### What is useReducer?

##### useReducer
Imagine a component with many handlers, we call the state updater fn inside each handler. Gets messy real fast. We can consolidate all state update logic outside your component in a single function called reducer.

So what's changed  is that we simply dispatch actions in the handlers. While all the updating logic is moved outside the component.

```ts
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

// tasks is the current state, action object is the obj you dispatch
// we are returning the next state given current state and some action
function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [...tasks, {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map(t => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

// Component
let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  { id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true },
  { id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false },
  { id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false }
];

export default function TaskApp() {
  // using the reducer
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(
    tasksReducer,
    initialTasks
  );

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask
        onAddTask={handleAddTask}
      />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```


##### Comparing useState and useReducer.
You write less code upfront with `useState`. With `useReducer`, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions.

With debugging, it's easier to debug with `useReducer`, as you can just add a console.log to your reducer to see action and what updated.

Reducer is also easier to test, and it's decoupled from the component, meaning you can test it in isolation.

Reducers must be pure, similar to state updater functions, reducers run during rendering (actions are queued until next render). They should not have any side effects and not update by mutate existing objects/arrays (should copy them).

Each action should describe a single user interaction.

#### What is Context? How to create and use Context?

Props drilling can be painful, not suitable for things like theming. because you would have to pass it to every component.

Context allows you to retrieve data from nearest parent.

1. Create a context.
2. Use that context from component that needs the data.
3. Provide that context from component that specifies the data.


1. Create context.
```ts
// Creating a context
import { createContext } from 'react';


// Here it's default value is 1, you can pass anything, even object
export const LevelContext = createContext(1);
```

2. Use the context.
```ts
import { useContext } from 'react';

// useContext is a hook. Tells React that Heading wants to read LevelContext.
export default function Heading({ children }) {

	const level = useContext(LevelContext);
	// ...
}
```

3. Provide the context.
```ts
// Tells React, if any component inside <Section> asks for LevelContext, give them this level. It will use nearest LevelContext.Provider in the UI tree.
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js'

export default function Section({ level, childrne }) {
	render() {
		<section className='section'>
		<LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
			{children}
		</LevelContext.Provider>
		</section>
	}
}
```
So we are passing a level prop to each Section, and every Section sets the level context for its children. So Headings inside the Section will get the closest `LevelContext`.



We can also remove the level prop entirely.

```ts
// App.js
import Heading from './Heading.js';
import Section from './Section.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Section> // 0th level, provide 1 to children
      <Heading>Title</Heading>
      <Section> // 1st level, provide 2 to children
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Section> // 2rd level, provide 3 to children
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Section> // 3rd level, provide 4 to children
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
          </Section>
        </Section>
      </Section>
    </Section>
  );
}
```

Inside a Section, we read the current level context. Then set `LevelContext.Provider` value to level + 1 for all its children. It works in this case cause structure is nested.

```ts
// Section
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

// Nested Section will read outer level section to get its level
export default function Section({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}

// Heading
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

// Note Heading component under each Section will read the level context
export default function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  switch (level) {
    case 0:
      throw Error('Heading must be inside a Section!');
    case 1:
      return <h1>{children}</h1>;
    case 2:
      return <h2>{children}</h2>;
    case 3:
      return <h3>{children}</h3>;
    case 4:
      return <h4>{children}</h4>;
    case 5:
      return <h5>{children}</h5>;
    case 6:
      return <h6>{children}</h6>;
    default:
      throw Error('Unknown level: ' + level);
  }
}
```

```ts
// LevelContext
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const LevelContext = createContext(0);
```


Before you use context.
1. Try props drilling. It's more explicit.
2. Extract components and pass JSX as children. Eg. Maybe you want to pass data props like `posts` to visual components that don't use them directly. 
Eg. 
`<Layout posts={posts}`

Instead make Layout take children as a prop. This reduces number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it.
`<Layout> <Post posts={posts} /> <Layout />`


If you pass different value of context on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below.




#### Using React Context effectively

1. Always export context.Provider as a HOC
2. Expose an API
3. Create a custom hook



Note all components that are descedent of context provider will trigger re-render when context value changes (whether they are actually updated/remounted into the DOM will depend on virtual DOM comparison).


```ts
const MyContext = React.createContext();

// 3. Export your own hook
export const useThemeContext = () => React.useContext(ThemeContext)



// 1. Always export your own provider!
// The reason for doing this is I have full control over value, I don't want others to be able to change value. I can give them props to alter value but I'm still in control.
export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')

  // for performance, function that returns handlers to alter vlaue.
  // 2. Creating handlers ensure our theme is never updated to invalid values.
  const handlers = React.useMemo(
    () => ({
      lighten: () => {
        setTheme('light')
      },
      darken: () => {
        setTheme('dark')
      },
      toggle: () => {
        setTheme(s => (s === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'))
      },
    }),
    [],
  )

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={[theme, handlers]}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}





function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="light">
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
