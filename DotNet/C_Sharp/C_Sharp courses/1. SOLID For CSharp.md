### How to know when to refactor
Do PDD - write your code in the simplest way you know. Avoid applying SOLID as premature optimisation. If code turns out to be a pain to work with, then apply SOLID.

### Single Responsibility Principle
#### What is Single Responsibility Principle? 
Loose coupling, and separation of concerns - high level code should have no knowledge about low level implementation details

Cohesion - How related how closely related elements of classes or modules are to one another. Higher responsibility -> Less cohesion

Coupling - relationship between classes
#### How to apply Single Responsibility Principle? Extract out
Extract out irrelevant responsibilities to other classes and dependency inject them.

##### Case study - Rating engine for rating insurance policy

Rating engine has a lot of responsibilities.
![[Pasted image 20240713184607.png]]

It also contains lots of business rules, validations, age calculations (age calculation is very low level detail ) etc
![[Pasted image 20240713184706.png]]
We can identify different responsibilities, like validations, age calculations, persistence, logging and encoding, and put them into separate classes and inject them.


### Open closed principle
Open for extension, closed for modification.

#### What is Open closed principle? What does Open to extension and closed to modification mean?

Open to extension
* Easy to add new behaviour

Closed to modification
* Changes to existing code is minimal, the less we are likely to change existing logic, the less we are likely to introduce bugs and break things.
* 
##### Examples
We want to balance abstraction and concreteness, as abstraction adds complexity.

Extreme case - Very closed
![[Pasted image 20240713190232.png]]
When you `new` an object, you're making the code concrete. The code is fine, until it isn't.

Extreme case - Very open
![[Pasted image 20240713190336.png|500]]
When writing code, we can start out being concrete, and wait and see how the application evolves overtime before making changes. E.g. By the 3rd time you have to modify the same area, consider refactoring to apply OCP.


#### Explains the 3 typical approaches to OCP
* Introduce new parameters to a function to change its behaviour
* Use inheritance, creating a new child class that inherits a type
* Dependency injection

Message is hard coded.
![[Pasted image 20240713190735.png|400]]

* Parameter based extension
	Introduce new parameter for hard coded values
 ![[Pasted image 20240713190832.png]]

* Inheritance based extension
	Mark parent class method as virtual so we can override in child class
![[Pasted image 20240713191016.png|400]]

* Injection
	Extract out logic and dep inject it as another class
 ![[Pasted image 20240713191045.png|400]]

We should prefer implementing new features in new classes.
This allows us to add functionalities without increasing complexity of existing system.

#### OCP Case study - removing switch statement by extracting logic to new classes, and instantiate the appropriate class through a factory class, so the switch is moved inside the factory, we can then use reflection to completely eliminate switch.
Currently inside `RatingEngine`, we load the policy first and then use switch statement to determine policy type and the logic.

If we want to add another policy we would have to add another case in the switch.
```csharp
public class RatingEngine {
        public decimal Rating { get; set; }
        
        public void Rate() {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting rate.");

            Console.WriteLine("Loading policy.");

            // load policy - open file policy.json
            string policyJson = File.ReadAllText("policy.json");

            var policy = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Policy>(policyJson,
                new StringEnumConverter());

            switch (policy.Type)
            {
                case PolicyType.Auto:
                    Console.WriteLine("Rating AUTO policy...");
                    Console.WriteLine("Validating policy.");
                    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(policy.Make))
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("Auto policy must specify Make");
                        return;
                    }
                    if (policy.Make == "BMW")
                    {
                        if (policy.Deductible < 500)
                        {
                            Rating = 1000m;
                        }
                        Rating = 900m;
                    }
                    break;
                case PolicyType.Land:
	                // ...
	                }
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}
                
```
We can extract the logic for every Policy and move that logic into its own type. Then we don't have to touch the logic here.

In this case, we can come up with different raters, like `AutoPolicyRater` or `LandPolicyRater` etc, where we encapsulate the rating logic.

We can then create a `RaterFactory` for creating different raters.
The switch statement has been moved to the factory.
Now RatingEngine is no longer responsible for determining which type to use what logic. Now the factory is responsible for it.
![[Pasted image 20240713192201.png]]

A new policy rater would look like below.
`Rate` method is open to extension ( creating a new class that derives `Rater` ) and closed for modification ( we don't need to change existing `Rater` classes when implementing a new `Rater` ) 
![[Pasted image 20240713192543.png]]

We can make apply OCP to factory as well via reflection.
If we don't find a matching class name, we just return null.
This completely eliminates the switch statement.
![[Pasted image 20240713192800.png]]


#### Applying OCP to packages/libraries
Nuget packages are closed for modifications from consumers.
* Consumers can't change package contents
* When packages authors update package, they should not break existing consumers.
* Packages should be open to extension - so consumers can extend the package to suit their own needs, usually via interfaces provided by the package.


### Liskov Substitution Principle

#### Explain Liskov Substitution Principle, its basic principle and with example to highlight problem

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

Inheritance - when `yy` is a `xx` , e.g. an `eagle` is a `bird`.

Property - when `zz` has a `ww`, e.g. a `address` has a `city`.

LSP states is...a relationship is insufficient, should be replaced with is...substitute for...

A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 right angles.

A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles.

Per geometry, a square is a rectangle.

However, if we treat Square as a subtype of Rectangle, we need to enforce the rule that width and height are the same for Square inside its setters.

Problem arises when we have some code that we expect to work with rectangle, but we used square. 

If the Square is passed in from somewhere else, then it would be hard to detect this anomaly.

![[Pasted image 20240713194232.png]]

Square has the invariant - 4 sides must be equal
Rectangle has the invariant - sides are independent

This design breaks rectangle's invariant and therefore violates LSP.

One solution is to eliminate square class like below, or we can have Square as a separate class not related to Rectangle.
![[Pasted image 20240713194456.png]]


#### What are common ways to detect LSP violations, is/as, null checks, NotImplementedException and why do they violate LSP?

##### Case study
* Using `is` or `as` inside polymorphic code
If you are checking the type of a variable with `is` or `as` inside code that should be polymorphic ( code that works with any subtype ), that's a clue of a violation

* Null checks inside polymorphic code - do YYY when something is null, we can fix using null object pattern, create a class to represent the null value, and implement the method there, and therefore it will never be null here.

* `NotImplementedException`, meaning the class that throws it does not yet support it. Either not substitutable or we have to implement it. So this derived class is NOT substitutable for the base class.

Here is a violation, the actual type of the employee should NOT be important in the logic.
![[Pasted image 20240713194810.png|500]]

Fix 1: To fix this, we need to make sure each `Employee` type implements `Print()` in its own class.
However be careful not to violate the single responsibility principle.
![[Pasted image 20240713194939.png]]

Fix 2: Or we could adjust the helper method so it works with any kind of employee.
We have now consolidated all employee type checks to one place.
![[Pasted image 20240713195045.png]]

Checking for null is the same behaviour as checking for type.
Meaning that we have different behaviours depending on whether the instance is null or not like below. Hence LSP violation.
![[Pasted image 20240713195146.png]]

Take away - Don't ask instances for their types, and then conditionally perform different actions. Instead encapsulate that logic in the type itself.

We can minimize null checks for guard clauses, nullables, or use exceptions to prevent null values from reaching primary logic in the code...

Make sure to fully implement interface


##### Case study - this violates LSP as it treats null differently
![[Pasted image 20240713195935.png]]

What we can do is introduce an `UnknownPolicyRater` and move the logic to there. And then modify the factory to return this if we can't find a matching `Rater` to a policy instead of returning null.

Null object pattern
![[Pasted image 20240713200013.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240713200114.png]]



### Interface segregation principle

#### Explain Interface segregation principle and what violating it is bad

Prefer small, cohesive interfaces to larger fatter ones.

An interface is defined as whatever can be accessible by consumer working with instance of that type, not just strictly C# interfaces.

![[Pasted image 20240713200744.png]]
Imagine inheriting an gigantic interface, recall not implementing some method is breaking LSP, which isn't ideal.

Violating ISP increase coupling as consumers will depend on things they don't use. Makes it harder to change/test.

#### How to detect ISP violations, why are they bad and how to fix them.
* Look for large interfaces
* See if there are any `NotImplementedException` or if any consumer using a small subset of a larger interface

We can split up interfaces.
Since C# support multiple interface inheritance, we can replace original fat interface with all new smaller interfaces when refactoring legacy code. Of course, this only works when you own the interface.

#### Fixing ISP violations
Larger interfaces makes it harder to implement, thus ISP is related to LSP. ISP relies on SRP and cohesion.

Use pain driven development, don't implement pre-maturely.

* Break up larger interfaces into smaller ones
* For larger interfaces you don't control, create small cohesive interfaces following adaptor design pattern
* Use clients to define interfaces, so all interface properties are used
* Interfaces should be declared where consumer and implementations can access it

#### Case study
We have a `IRatingContext` class property for the rating engine.
Notice every line calls the `Context` methods.
![[Pasted image 20240713202319.png]]

Fat interface - to fix this, breakdown into smaller interfaces, have the original interface inheriting the smaller interfaces ( so the relevant methods are removed from the original interface and moved to the new smaller interfaces )




### Dependency Inversion

#### Explain DI, why should we not expose implementation details?
High level modules should not depend on low level modules, both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions in C# are interfaces and abstract base classes.

##### Examples of Abstractions and Details
Abstraction describes what
* Send an email
* Store a customer record

Details specify how
* sends an SMTP email over port 25
* Serialise customer to json and store in a text file


This is a high level interface, yet it exposes implementation details.
Creating coupling as client must pass in and deal with those concrete types.
![[Pasted image 20240713222754.png]]

This fixes it.
![[Pasted image 20240713222901.png]]

#### What are some examples of low level dependencies and why are they bad when newing them inside high level modules?
Some low level dependencies examples
![[Pasted image 20240713223026.png]]

`new` keyword is glue, creating an instance of some low level implementation in your high level class creates a tight coupling, what if you want to swap out some dependency later? Much harder now since the low level implementation is exposed to our high level class.
We should ideally depend on abstractions and inject those abstraction dependencies via injection through constructor.
We can configure DI(service) containers to map abstraction/interfaces to concrete implementations.

#### Case study
Currently the Rating engine relies upon the `DefaultRatingContext` heavily for various functionalities, how to load the source policy, how to deserialise...
![[Pasted image 20240713230529.png]]
`Rate()` above calls log, loads policy from file and create a `Rater` based on the policy and context before finally rating the policy.

We want to apply DI so `RatingEngine` does not depend on the concrete `RatingContext`.


* Concrete Log is glued to the Context, so we can instead inject ILogger into `RatingEngine`.
	Now it looks like below
![[Pasted image 20240713230949.png]]
Issue - the hardcoded dependencies on context is gluing `Rate()` to file access.

Currently inside the context, we instantiate a concrete implementation of `FilePolicySource` inside the method.
![[Pasted image 20240713231404.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240713231418.png]]

Fix
We can address it by injecting `IPolicySource` into `DefaultRatingContext` constructor.
![[Pasted image 20240713231548.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240713231632.png]]

Going back to `Rate()` inside `RatingEngine`
We are hardcoding the policy by loading it from a file as json string.
We can extract out serialisation and inject it.
![[Pasted image 20240713231803.png]]

After
Notice we inject serialiser into `RatingEngine` and pass it to `RatingContext`
![[Pasted image 20240713231921.png]]

And instead of relying on the context to get policy from string, since we now have access to serialiser via injection, we can use it directly inside `RatingEngine`
![[Pasted image 20240713232202.png]]

Now we need to clean up `CreateRaterForPolicy`, this is delegating creation of rater to the factory method.
![[Pasted image 20240713232343.png]]
The factory needs `IRatingContext`, but it really just use the `Engine` property, to create a `RatingUpdater`. So it really just needs a `RatingUpdater`, and we can inject that.

![[Pasted image 20240713232518.png]]


##### Be careful of circular dependencies
Our `RatingUpdater` depends on `RatingEngine` to update rating. 
Creating `RatingEngine` requires a `RaterFactory`.
And creating a `RaterFactory` requires a `RatingUpdater`.
![[Pasted image 20240713224758.png|400]]

We can fix this by eliminating `RatingUpdater`.
So instead `Rater` replying on `RatingUpdater` like below.
![[Pasted image 20240713232900.png]]

After
Rater now no longer requires a Rating updater
![[Pasted image 20240713232928.png]]




After refactor
![[Pasted image 20240713225109.png]]



Following solid principles leading to more files.

We can organise our project by using feature folders.
Eg. An online store project may have folders for catalog, search, order etc.
Then each feature folder will have interfaces, services, models etc.
