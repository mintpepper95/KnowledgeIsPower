Based on the `LINQ Fundamentals` course on pluralsight

### LINQ operations
We can 
* select
* do projection (change shape of data)
* ordering (ascending, descending)
* get some element (find, first, last, single)
* filter (where)
* Iteration (foreach, skip, take)
* Quantify (any, all, contains)
* Set Comparison (equal, except, intersection)
* Set Operations (union, concat) - union is concat followed by distinct, concat does not remove dupes
* Joins (inner joins, outer joins)
* Grouping (groupby, subquery, groupjoin)
* Distinct Sets (distinct)
* Aggregation (count, sum, min, max, average)


### Use LINQ to select data

#### Selecting all items
```cs
// gets product from repository
List<Product> products = GetProducts();

// query syntax
// from each item in the list, select the entire object
// without `ToList()`, it would be of type IEnumerable
var list = (from p in products select p).ToList();


// method syntax
var list = products.Select(prod => prod).ToList();
```

#### Selecting a single col
```cs
var list = new List<string>();

// query
list.AddRange(from prod in products select prod.Name);

// method
list.AddRange(products.Select(p => p.Name));
```

#### Get specific columns
```cs
// Here I map each prod to a new Product object, but only partially filling it
var list = (from prod in products
	select new Product {
		ProductId = prod.ProductId,
		Name = prod.Name,
		Size = prod.Size
	}).ToList();


var list = products.Select(p => new Product { 
	ProductId = p.ProductId,
	Name = p.Name,
	Size = p.Size	
}).ToList();
```

#### Creating anonymous class
```cs

```
