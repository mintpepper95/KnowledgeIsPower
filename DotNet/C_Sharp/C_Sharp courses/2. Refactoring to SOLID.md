Based on the `Refactoring to SOLID C# Code` course on pluralsight

---
Aside from the basic SOLID principles.
Use `decimal` instead of `float` for prices to avoid rounding error.

Avoid static classes as we can't do dependency injection with those. Because in C# static class constructor does not accept any parameters.

Declare a variable near where you would use it, not at very top to avoid cognitive overload.

Make sure there's no mixed levels of abstractions, like high level business code with low level implementation details put together. 

If we have an instance of the class `Kitchen`, it's NOT the `Kitchen`'s responsibility to get itself from some db, `kitchen.GetCustomerKitchen(kitchenId, userName)`. This violates the single responsibility principle. Use `repository` or directly with `dbcontext`.

---
#### Applying Single Principle Responsibility

When a class accepts a lot of primitives, we could put them into a separate type like below. 

Here we introduced a `PriceRequest` struct for bundling all the primitives. Then we call the original function inside our new `CalculatePrice` with `PricrRequest`.

We can then call this new code with object initialiser syntax.

Once we are done, we can now replace the original `CalculatePrice()` by updating the parameters to take in a `PriceRequest`.

---

The `CalculatePrice()` returns `0|0|0`, a string of prices. We can refactor it such that it returns 3 decimals instead, we can define a record for the return value.
```csharp
public record PriceGroup(decimal Subtotal, decimal SubtotalFalt, decimal SubtotalPlus);
```

---

We can group primitive variables into a record struct inside `CalculatePrice()`.
```csharp
public record struct Subtotals() {
	public decimal Value { get; set; }
	public decimal Flat { get; set; }
	public decimal Plus { get; set; }
}
```

---

#### Applying Dependency Injection and Interface Segregation Principle

Within `CalculatePrice()`, we have numerous places where we fetch something from a sqlite db. Extract this out to a method initially.

Look at the methods we have extracted, and put the relevant ones into new interfaces.
Then we create the concrete class for these implementations.
Dependency inject the new class via interface into `PricingService`, and update the code to call the injected service.

Then in `Program.cs`, specify the DI.
`builder.Services.AddScoped<IOrderDataService, SqliteOrderDataService>();`

---

Inside `PricingService` main method, there are multiple places where we check if `priceRequest.refType is 'Order' or 'PriceReport'` , and do things differently.

We want to introduce an interface so we can replace this conditional with polymorphism. So that we can call some method on the interface, and it will auto do the right thing depending on which strategy we provide. Default strategy, Order strategy and PriceReport strategy.

Strategy design pattern to introduce new strategy, and now we can move all the logic inside `if...else` to the new places.
```csharp
public interface IPriceCalculationStrategy {
	void Create(Kitchen kitchen);
}

public class PriceReportCalculationStrategy: IPriceCalculationStrategy {
	public void Create(Kitchen kitchen) {
		// do stuff
	}
}

public class NewOrderCalculationStrategy: IPriceCalculationStrategy {
	public void Create(Kitchen kitchen) {
		// do stuff
	}
}

public class Defaulttrategy: IPriceCalculationStrategy {
	public void Create(Kitchen kitchen) {
		// Do nothing
	}
}


// add them to DI in Program.cs, since some will use other services
// So classes that needs NewOrder or PriceReport, we can just inject the concrete class.
builder.Services.AddScoped<IPriceCalculationStrategy, DefaultCalculationStratergy>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<PriceReportCalculationStratergy>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<NewOrderCalculationStratergy>();


// usage, now polymorphism
CalculatePrice(PriceRequest request, IPriceCalculationStrategy strategy);
```



##### Some words on `Using` and `IDisposable`
I want to mention a bit about `Using` and `IDisposable`.
For stream writer, if we only use it once inside a method, then fine to use `Using` for immediate dispose after calling. But if stream writer is a class level resource that maybe used across multiple method or needs to kept for an extended period of time, then implement `IDisposable`, this ensures stream writer is properly disposed when class instance is no longer needed.

```csharp
public class Service : IDisposable {
	private StreamWriter writer;

	public void DoStuff() {
		writer = new StreamWriter('some_directory');
		// write stuff
	}

	public void Dispose() {
		if (writer != null) {
			writer.Close();
			writer.Dispose();
		}
	}
}
```


If we don't dispose properly, several things can happen.
* Memory leaks - stream writer holds refs to various objects, those objects may not be released without proper disposal, so cause memory leaks 
* If files are not properly closed, it can remain locked, prevent other processes from modifying it

Follow the following simple approaching
* Identify places where we can have abstractions, introduce new interface *
* Move behaviours into new classes that implements the new interfaces
* DI to inject the new classes into our code
* Configure DI in Program.cs

---
#### Refactor to follow OCP and LIS

##### Cross-cutting concerns
We want to keep these separate as much as possible
* Business Rules
* Data Access/Persistence 
* Validation
* Logging
* Exception handling
* Monitoring

##### Decorator pattern
```csharp
public class PricingServiceDecorator : IPricingService {
	private readonly PricingService _pricingService;
	
	public PricingServiceDecorator(PricingService pricingService) {
		_pricingService = pricingService;_
	}

	public XXX CalculatePrice(
		PriceRquest request,
		IPriceCalculationStrategy priceCalculationStrategy
	) {
		// pull out the try...catch logic in original code as well as session
		// gets some data
		Context.Session['xxx'];
		
		try {
			_pricingService.CalculatePrice(request, priceCalculationStrategy);
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			// handle	
		}
	}
}


// Now in Program CS, get Decorator instead of original
builder.Services.AddScoped<IPricingService, PricingServiceDecorator>();
```

Remember, interfaces are for WHAT, implementations are for HOW.

A tip of Visual Studio, if you have a long type name, just type capital letters.

Another tip, we can also extract a class to its own file with visual studio shortcut.

In this sec
* We pulled error handling and session access out into a decorator 
* We pulled out DataAccess logic and moved them into services and then injecting them via DI
* Now the pricing method focuses on business logic


#### Assessing and testing refactored code
Uses fluent assertions and x unit

A few words about string interpolation and format specifier
```csharp
int x = 14;

// x is the variable, x2 means two digit hex string
string s = $"{x:x2}";
```

For code with `StreamWriter` , we can pass in `StringWriter` for testing.
By checking `writer.ToString()` with the expected string.
```csharp
var result = writer.ToString();
result.Should().Contain("xxx");
```

A few words on C# naming conventions.

All method names in C# start with an upper-case letter by convention. All property names do so too. Only private fields, local variables and parameters to methods start with a lower-case letter.
