Attributes is a declarative tag used to convey info/metadata to runtime about behaviours of elements like classes, methods, structs, enumerators, assembies etc...

Attributes are used for adding metadata.

Consider `ObsoleteAttribute`, it can be applied to classes, structs, methods, constructors and more. It declares that element is obsolete.
