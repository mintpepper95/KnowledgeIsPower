1. Scalability - scale horizontally or vertically to accommodate increasing user loads or data volumes. Horizontal scaling is add more servers to handle workload, vertical scaling is upgrading hardware. 
2. Caching - for retrieving frequently accessed data/computations.
3. Load balancing - Evenly distributing workload across multiple servers to enhance system responsiveness.
4. Algo - Better algo and data structures.
5. DB - db indexing, db query optimisation, denormalization
6. Async processing - event driven architecture
7. Performance profiling - load test, A/B testing
8. Performance monitoring - eg. datadog
