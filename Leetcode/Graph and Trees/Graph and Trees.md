Typical DFS problem, can either apply classical DFS or iterative (which is more efficient)
Note we use DFS instead of BFS due to space advantage
[[1992. Find All Groups of Farmland]]

Simple BFS
[[623. Add One Row to Tree]]

BFS to find min # of moves
[[752. Open the Lock]]

This question is about finding the min height tree -> which is really about finding the longest path, we find the mid point in such paths by keep eliminating the leaves until there is only 1 or 2 nodes left
[[310. Minimum Height Trees]]

Really just a DFS algo with tracking root of the current traversal
