Not difficult.
Since it's asking about subsequence (non-contiguous), means we can't use two pointer techniques eg. (sliding window) as they only work on contiguous arrays.

Then most likely dp ( which it is )
Analysed the problem carefully to come up with the dp approach.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def longestIdealString(self, s, k):
        # IDEA - we want each adjacent pair to have abs diff <= k
        # for any letter x, we loop through all 26 chars in the alphabets
        # to find the longest length by comparing letters appeared in string before with x,
        # such their abs diff <= k
        # memo[letter] will track the longest ideal subsequence length the last time letter appeared
        memo = {}

        for letter in s:
            letter_idx = ord(letter)
            
            # loop through all 26 letters,
            # or we can just loop through the entire dict keys
            best = 0
            
            for other_letter in memo:
                alphabet_idx = ord(other_letter)
                
                # make sure diff <= k
                diff = abs(letter_idx - alphabet_idx)

                if diff <= k:
                    # update best
                    best = max(best, memo[other_letter] + 1)

            # update memo
            memo[letter] = max(1, best)

        # return memo with max value
        return max(memo.values())
```
