Go through all major components of FE rendering - accessibility, observability, ARIA, performance rendering etc

Systems design: ·jira active sprint board (each task can have multiple tags)·, what components would you use, how would you optimize the FE loading of thousands/millions of jira tickets, how would you measure performance.

The system design was more focused on the data model, request and response payload, and state management with state normalization.


You need to know the how to form the structure of the API response, what endpoint do you think you need, and how does the response translate into application state


#### Time allocation 
##### Functional & non-functional requirements gathering 10 min
Identify the list of requirements.
From those requirements identify the entities and their relations.
Think about access patterns and mutability.
Also think about non-functional requirements, eg. performance & availability.

##### Data Types, API and Scale 10 min
Describe the data types. What the API (REST or something else) look like. And think about volume of request we need to serve.

##### Design 10min
Data Storage and microservices.
